Redux 
- Action (What to do);
- Reducer (How to do);
store(global single )


Redux only deal with functions without side effects


#=> or if we want to use sideEffects in redux so we have to use Thunk

#] Action => pure object
emp= {type: "INC", payload:1}


#] Reducer=> pure function it conist two perameter (current state, action)
       => it updating the redux store 

#] Store =>  single global storage system
       =>  that must be rap in to top side
       => if store update re-render happen
       => it always expect single reducer           




#] React-Redux => 

1> useSelector()
2> useDispatch() 

#] Connect - Higher Order Function



The connect 
it provide its connected components with the pieces of the data in it needs from the store, and the functions 
it can be used to dispatch action to the store.
